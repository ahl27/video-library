    name: "Webinar Series: Galaxy Resources For.."
    description: |
       Each of the 4 webinars in this series that ran earlier this year
       highlights avaialble Galaxy resources for a different audience. These
       videos are a nice way to get an overview of what Galaxy has to offer for
       different types of users.

sequence-analysis/mapping:
    description: |
        Mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome is often the next step
        after QC. This session covers the basic concepts of mapping and the
        practical will guide you through performing a mapping step on sequending data.
