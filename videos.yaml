statistics/machine-learning-classification/slides:
  description: The talk includes a lecture followed by a hands-on session to apply
    multiple classification algorithms on the Quantitative structure-activity relationship
    (QSAR) dataset to predict the biodegradable activity of chemical compounds. QSAR
    models attempt to predict the activity or property of chemicals based on their
    chemical structure. To achieve this, a database of compounds is collected for
    which the property of interest is known. For each compound, molecular descriptors
    are collected which describe the structure (for example - molecular weight, number
    of nitrogen atoms, number of carbon-carbon double bonds). Using these descriptors,
    a model is constructed which is capable of predicting the property of interest
    for a new, unknown molecule. In this tutorial, we will use a database assembled
    from experimental data of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry
    to create a classification model by applying simple and complex classifiers to
    learn the nature of biodegradation. We will use this model to classify new molecules
    into one of two classes - biodegradable or non-biodegradable. Different visualisations
    are used to analyze the results after applying each classification algorithm.
    Hyperparameters of one of the classifiers are also optimised.

Deep Neural Networks Demystified:
  description: Artificial neural networks are a machine learning discipline roughly
    inspired by how neurons in a human brain work. In the past decade, there has been
    a huge resurgence of neural networks thanks to the vast availability of data and
    enormous increases in computing capacity (Successfully training complex neural
    networks in some domains requires lots of data and compute capacity). There are
    various types of neural networks, 3 of which we will cover in this set of tutorials.

Regression in Machine LearningSlides:
  description: The talk includes a lecture followed by a hands-on session to apply
    multiple regression algorithms on the DNA-methylation dataset to predict biological
    age. In this tutorial, we will build a regression model for chronological age
    prediction, based on DNA methylation. This is based on the work of Jana Naue et
    al. 2017, in which biomarkers are examined to predict the chronological age of
    humans by analyzing the DNA methylation patterns. Different machine learning algorithms
    are used in this study to make an age prediction. It has been recognized that
    within each individual, the level of DNA methylation changes with age. This knowledge
    is used to select useful biomarkers from DNA methylation datasets. The CpG sites
    with the highest correlation to age are selected as the biomarkers (and therefore
    features for building a regression model). In this tutorial, specific biomarkers
    are analyzed by machine learning algorithms to create an age prediction model.
    Multiple visualisations are also used to analyse the predictions made by simple
    and complex regressors and hyperparameters of one of the regressors also optimised.

Visualization of RNA-Seq results with Volcano Plot in Galaxy and R:
  description: Volcano plots are commonly used to display the results of RNA-seq or
    other omics experiments. A volcano plot is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical
    significance (P value) versus magnitude of change (fold change). It enables quick
    visual identification of genes with large fold changes that are also statistically
    significant. These tutorials will first teach you how to create such plots from
    your RNA-Seq results in Galaxy, and then how you can further customized the plots
    using R directly within Galaxy.

  description: Terrestrial ecosystem models have been widely used to study the impact

epigenetics/tutorials/Slides:
  description: 'In many eukaryotic organisms, such as humans, the genome is tightly

    packed and organized with the help of nucleosomes (chromatin). A

    nucleosome is a complex formed by eight histone proteins that is

    wrapped with ~147bp of DNA. When the DNA is being actively transcribed

    into RNA, the DNA will be opened and loosened from the nucleosome

    complex. Many factors, such as the chromatin structure, the position

    of the nucleosomes, and histone modifications, play an important role

    in the organization and accessibility of the DNA. Consequently, these

    factors are also important for the activation and inactivation of

    genes. Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing

    (ATAC-Seq) is a method to investigate the accessibility of chromatin

    and thus a method to determine regulatory mechanisms of gene

    expression. The method can help identify promoter regions and

    potential enhancers and silencers.

    newer compressed data type generated from raw submission data for sequences containing
    hits to SARS-CoV-2 is also accessible to Galaxy users from SRA in the Cloud.


    SRA Aligned Read Format (SARFs) provides further output options other than basic
    FASTQ format, for example:

    1. contigs created from the raw reads in the run (FASTA format)

    2. reads aligned back to the contigs (SAM format)

    3. VCF files generated for each record relative to the SARS-CoV-2 RefSeq record.


    We will demonstrate how to access just the reads (FASTA or FASTQ format), just
    the contigs, the reads aligned to the contigs and VCF files for selected SARFs.
    These formats can speed up workflows such as assembly and variant calling, and
    this data format is still referenced by the run accession and accessed using the

  description: In this tutorial, we will analyze RNA sequencing data to extract information
    about potential genes regulated in response to abiotic stress in plants. For this
    purpose, the chosen approach is the identification of genes with complementary
    regions to miRNAs upregulated in response to brassinosteroids.

  description: Single cell RNA-seq analysis is a cornerstone of developmental research
    and provides a great level of detail in understanding the underlying dynamic processes
    within tissues. In the context of plants, this highlights some of the key differentiation
    pathways that root cells undergo.
