:sparkles: **Let's Get Started!** :sparkles:

This is probably  different kind of training than you have attended before. This is completely _asynchronous_ workshop. There are tutorials and recordings online, and you are free to go through these at your own pace.

For this training week there is *no fixed schedule*, instead we provide a set of modules for you to choose from.

- This week YOU make the schedule, YOU decide which tutorials to follow, and when to start, stop, and take breaks. Find modules which are interesting to you.
- New to Galaxy? We suggest you start with the 'Introduction to Galaxy' module, followed by the ['Bioinformatics Buffet' module](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/modules/bioinformatics-buffet).
- Unsure which tutorial to follow? Feel free to ask us for recommendations in Slack!


:ice_cube: **Today's Icebreaker** :ice_cube:

Head over to <SOCIAL_CHANNEL> and let us know the answer to this important question:

> **Introduce yourself and tell us one fun fact about yourself!** and **What are you hoping to learn this week?**


:computer: **Doing the tutorials** :computer:

Whenever you're ready to get started, find the module of interest in your track, and:

- Join the Slack channel for that tutorial (found below video) and let us know you are starting the tutorial!
- Start the video and enjoy! All information you need for the tutorial can be found below the video (and on the GTN tutorial page).
- Done with a tutorial? Leave a message in the Slack channel with your thoughts about it and/or thanking your instructors!
- Want a certificate for the coures? Use the [Certificate Bot](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/certbot) in the tutorial Slack channel to submit your Galaxy History so we can add the training to your certificate

:question: **Questions** :question:

When asking a question:

1. Ask in the appropriate place (#general for general issues, or the tutorial specific channel.)
2. Use threads as much as possible
3. Share your Galaxy history ([instructions](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_sharing.html)). This makes it easier for instructors to help you!
