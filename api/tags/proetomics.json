      "description": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has had a profound, lasting impact on the world's population. Accurate and timely diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is an important step for providing care and containing its further spread. In this tutorial, attendees will be introduced to two workflows â€“ a) database search workflow and b) peptide validation workflow. Attendees of the workshop will get an in-depth knowledge of the Galaxy workflows that detect SARS-CoV-2 peptides ([10.1186/s12014-021-09321-1)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12014-021-09321-1)) and co-infecting pathogen peptides ([10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00822](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00822)).",
