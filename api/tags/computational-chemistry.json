      "description": "Cheminformatics is the use of computational techniques and information about molecules to solve problems in chemistry. This involves a number of steps: retrieving data on chemical compounds, sorting data for properties which are of interest, and extracting new information. This tutorial will provide a brief overview of all of these, centered around protein-ligand docking, a molecular modelling technique.",
