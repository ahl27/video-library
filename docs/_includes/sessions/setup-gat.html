         <li>It is best if you have an SSH client pre-installed, but it is not strictly necessary. However, all VMs have a terminal available on port 8080 if you cannot install one. </li>
         <li>Windows users can choose to install <a href="https://chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">PuTTY</a> or equivalent. </li>
         <li>For Linux & OSX: You should have an ssh client already installedx </li>

        By the time of the workshop, you should be familiar with the Unix command line. Everyone has a different background and if you haven't had to learn Unix shell basics before that's ok! We recommend that you go through <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">The Unix Shell lesson</a> from The Carpentries.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
Additionally you need to be comfortable with a command-line text editor. If you have not had to use one before, then nano is recommended. If you have a preferred one (e.g. vim or emacs), you are welcome to use that.
