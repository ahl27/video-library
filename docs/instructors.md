          description: |
            Have a look at the [course page for your event](./events)
            here you will see all the content that will be covered.
            <br>
            If you you see any mistakes, please let us know!
            <br><br>
            Below each training video, there is a table with all relevant information regarding
            the tutorial, including **link to the corresponding GTN tutorial**, which you may wish
            to read ahead of time.
            <br><br>
            In table you will also find a link to a **Slack channel**.
            This is where participants will ask any questions about this tutorial.
            **Please join all the channels you want to help out with!**.
            <br><br>

          title: Add Yourself to the Instructor List
          description: |
            We would like to add all instructors to the [Video Library Hall-of-Fame](./contributors)! (And to your event page).

            1. **Familiar with git?** Add yourself to the [instructors.yaml](https://github.com/gallantries/video-library/blob/main/docs/instructors.yaml)
               file and create a Pull Request
            2. **Not familiar with git?** No problem! Just provide us with your name, affiation, and (optionally) a profile picture, and we will add you to the list. You can ask in the [#instructors](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C01ES97MZBN) channel of Slack (or via DM)
      - custom:
          title: Create a 30-second introduction video (optional)
          description: |
            For some events (such as the annual Smorgasbord), we like to have a *Meet your
            instructors* video as part of the welcome session.

          title: Tutorial Testing
          description: |
            You can help greatly by helping us test materials ahead of time!

            1. Check the event web page, does it look correct? any broken links? etc
            2. Run a tutorial and let us know if it works or not

          title: Icebreakers
          description: |
            To encourage engagement on Slack, many events have **icebreaker questions**

            **Instructors are encouraged to answer these the daily icebreakers** in Slack as
            well, and respond to the answers from participants

            Our aim is to provide a fun environment for all, and make it easier for participants
            to ask questions about the tutorial in Slack. The more activity there is on Slack,
            the lower the barrier for shy participants to join in!

      - custom:
          title: Answering Questions
          description: |
            1. Join the Slack channels for all trainings you want to help out with.
            2. Just keep an eye on Slack throughout the event, when you can.
            3. You are NOT expected to be around all the time; we all have jobs and other
               commitments, just help out when you have some time!
      - custom:
          title: When you don't know an answer
          description: |
            That is totally ok!

            You can either:
            1. Check the tutorial FAQ page (link in table below video, top of Slack channel)
            2. Wait for somebody else to answer it
            3. Ping an instructor who you think might know the answer
            4. **Has question gone unanswered for a long time?** post a link to it
               in the #instructors channel to see if anybody knows the answer (other instructors
               may not have seen the question)
            5. Remind the participant to **be patient**, some questions can only be answered by a
               small number of instructors, who may not be around right now, but they will
               provide an answer eventually.
      - custom:
          title: When there is a problem with the Galaxy server
          description: |
            Many questions may be about a tool not working as expected, or other problems with Galaxy
            If you suspect that the problem is with the server, rather than a mistake by the
            participant, please:

            1. Ask participant which server they are using
            2. Link to the question in the #instructors channel
            3. Ping one of the admins/representatives for that server
               - Galaxy Main (US): **@Nate Coraor, @Jen Hillman-Jackson**
               - Galaxy EU: **@Gianmauro Cuccuro, @Björn Grüning**
               - Galaxy AU: **@Simon Gladman, @Anna Syme**

          title: Code of Conduct violations
          description: |
            GTN events have a [Code of Conduct](https://galaxyproject.org/community/coc/) that
            we expect all participants and instructors to honour.

            If you witness any violations, report it in the
            [#instructors](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C01ES97MZBN) channel on
            Slack, and one of the members of the
            [CoC committee](https://galaxyproject.org/community/coc/#reporting-issues) will
            handle it further.

          title: I can't find tool X!
          description: |
            If a participant can't find a tool:
            1. Make sure they are working on one of the supporting servers.
            2. Tool search sometimes doesn't return the right results
               - Encourage them to use GTN-in-Galaxy, many tutorials will have direct links to
                 the correct tools this way
            4. Think something else is wrong? Report it in [#instructors](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C01ES97MZBN) channel
               and ping the admins of that server (see *When there is a problem with the
               Galaxy server*)

      - custom:
          title: Tool Y isn't working!
          description: |
            If a participant reports a tool is not working, please ascertain:
            1. Which Galaxy server are they using?
            2. Make sure they have used the correct settings and input files
            3. It can be useful to have them **share their history** with you
               ([instruction](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_sharing.html))
            4. If you think there is a problem with the server, report it in [#instructors](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C01ES97MZBN) channel
               and ping the admins of that server.

      - custom:
          title: "[Smörgåsbord] I don't know what tutorials to do!"
          description: |
            For Smörgåsbord events, we don't offer a fixed program, but participants
            can pick and choose which tutorials they want to follow. This flexibility can be
            overwhelming for some.

            If people are new to the bioinformatics world and don't know where to start, you
            can recommend the [Bioinformatics Buffet](./modules/bioinformatics-buffet) module. This covers the introductory
            sessions for a range of popular topics.
