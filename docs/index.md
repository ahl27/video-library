Welcome to the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) Video Library!

A large collection of video tutorials around the [Galaxy training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org). These videos are suitable for self-study, or may be freely re-used by educators as part of their own workshops, courses and curricula.

This content is made available by a global community of contributors.

### How to use this website

- **For learners:** Here you can view and follow all the latest GTN video tutorials, and learn all about Galaxy and data analysis!
- **For instructors and event organizers:** You can re-use these videos for your own lessons and workshops. Use our course builder to create your own program and get a free event page with course handbook and all the resources you need for your Galaxy training event!

### Quick Start

The easiest way to find a video for a GTN tutorial that you are interested in, is via the [GTN website](https://training.galaxyproject.org). Look at the overview box at the top of the tutorial, and look for the  **<i class="fas fa-video"></i> GTN Video Library** dropdown that will appear here if there is a video for that tutorial:
