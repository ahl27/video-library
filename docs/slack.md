  We will be using Slack as our main communication and support channel. This is where
  participants can ask all their questions about the tutorials, about the science,
  about Galaxy, about anything really.

  See the official [Slack help center](https://slack.com/help) for an in-depth guide to Slack.

           description: |
             During the event, we will use the following channels:
               - **Tutorial channels**
                  - Each tutorial has a dedicated channel. You will find the link to this channel
                    below the tutorial video.
               - **Event channel**
                  - Most events will have a dedicated channel for participants and instructors
                    of that event
                  - This channel will start wih **#event_**
                  - Any questions specific to the event should go here
               - **Other channels**
                 - [**#announcements**](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C01ES8R0RNG): Only instructors can post here; keep an eye on this channel for important announcements.
                 - [**#social**](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C01EDBVMHBQ): introduce yourself, chat with each other, socialize, have fun!
                 - [**#general**](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C01MNM98X9V): any general questions about the GTN, Galaxy, Slack, etc can go here
                 - [**#random**](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C01LZ06AZ9P): for anything off-topic.
                   - Here you can promote your projects, post job openings, and anything else you think might be of interest to people here, but is not related to training.
                   - These kinds of of-topic posts will be removed from other channels
