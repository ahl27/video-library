This document provides a brief overview of the various roles 


## Module Leads

Being a module lead is a key part of making a *Sustainable Smörgåsbord*! This involves:

- [Evaluating the current modules](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EKf1D9NrlZojWVOpALsFZod9928ZBBCYOqJ16GSL9M4/edit):
    - Deciding which are ok
    - Or which need to be re-recorded
- Deciding whether you would like to add any sessions to your module
- And then identifying speakers to record these videos and helping them through the process. (And we will help you to do that of course.)

We expect it will take probably 1-2 hours to review your current module as you'll need to check the current state of the tutorials and compare to the videos. Is the tutorial too far diverged? Or does the video use Galaxy features which are now removed? Does it use Galaxy's history interface heavily which is now changed?

The knowledge of any additional sessions that would be a good fit is up to you and your knowledge as a subject matter expert.

## Presenter

We're very excited to have people presenting content at Smörgåsbord!

We **strongly** encourage you to follow the [Recording Guide]({% link docs/docs/recording.md %}) which provides key information as to how best to record videos for the Smörgåsbord event series.

As we are very keen to keep this event accessible to everyone, ensuring you have a good zoom level and mouse cursor is key.

## During-Week Technical Support

Please see the much more detailed [Instructor Guide]({% link docs/instrucotrs.md %})
